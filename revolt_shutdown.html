    <h1>Revolt.chat is shutting down. :(</h1>
    <p>I know, I also wish this wasn't true, but sometimes we just have to accept that it was boud to happen someday.</p> 

    <h2><b>How did we get the news?</b></h2>
    <p>The sad news were revealed today in the #general chat of Revolt Lounge. Ironically it was from a Discord person using the bridge.
    After some minutes of discussing it with the other regulars and users in chat some of development team joined and cofirmed our fears.
    Revolt is going to shut down tomorrow due to Discord acquiring Revolt.chat. We always thought that it was going to be a lawsuit first, but I guess
    they were planning on getting rid of competition faster.</p>

    <p>During the day we experienced downtimes and slower response time from Revolt. I guess Discord was already going at it.</p>

	<h2><b>One of the better platforms</b></h2>
    <p>Revolt.chat was a really goor platform and it had potential. The client was great for its customization features; all the themes that creative people have made. So many goofy moments and memes and laughs. I am grateful for all the amazing people that've met over there. I hope maybe we can reunite making another Revolt.</p>

    <h2><b>Goodbye Revolt!</b></h2>
    <p>Going to miss you!</p>
