      Greetings! My real name is Angelo Rafael [―], but I go by the name of Loki Calmito on the internet. 
      I'm a, let's say advanced beginner programmer interested in libre & minimalist software,
      3D artist struggling with creativity in Blender and oh, I also want to write stories (will get to it eventually).
    </p>

    <p>
      As for when I go touch grass, I have a camera and photograph various things. 
      I also play the piano... whenever the keyboard works (it's old) :).
      I know you're wondering what's one of my favorite pieces so here you go:

      <b>Fly</b> ― Ludovico Einaudi.
